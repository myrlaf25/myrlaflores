        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p>I am currently transitioning from working full time with the State of Arizona
            to being a student. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp 2021.
            I was raised in Douglas, AZ and graduated from High School in 2001.
        <p>I currently reside
            in Tucson, AZ. I was very fortunate to be a first generation in my family to obtain
            a Bachelor’s Degree. I have a Bachelor’s of Science in Psychology from The University
            of Arizona.</p>
        <p>I am starting from scratch, when it comes to coding. I very soon came to find out
            that coding is hard and there is a lot of information/concepts to learn. However, it is great to know
            there are unlimited resources out there. I have always liked to create things and computers.
            This is the reason why I decided that Web Development was for me. I am super excited and
            looking forward to this new adventure. </p>
