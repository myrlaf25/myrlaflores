        <h2> About me </h2>
        <p>I am currently transitioning from working full time with the State of Arizona 
            to being a student. I am currently enrolled in a Full Stack Coding Bootcamp 2021.
            I was raised in Douglas, AZ and graduated from High School in 2001. I currently reside 
            in Tucson, AZ. I was very fortunate to be a first generation in my family to obtain 
            a Bachelor’s Degree. I have a Bachelor’s of Science in Psychology from The University 
            of Arizona. I am starting from scratch, when it comes to coding. I very soon came to find out
            that coding is hard nad there is a lot of information/concepts to learn. However, it is great to know
            there are unlimited resources out there. I have always liked to create things and computers. 
            This is the reason why I decided that Web Development was for me. I am super excited and 
            looking forward to this new adventure. </p>
