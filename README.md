## Description

MyrlaFlores is a webpage where I am able to showcase the things I have been learning in my Full Stack Bootcamp Program. I will try to incorporate more things as the class progresses. I will be starting this portfolio with HTML and CSS to include flexbox, media queries and CSS variables.

It was challenging to create this webpage from scratch yet it has been of great experience. 

I was able to add a recent photo of me, a link to email me, a link to my Github, and a link to my LinkedIn.

<img id="my-img" src="assets/meinpink.jpg" alt="photo holder" width="30%"></img>

There are navigation links on the top of the page. The link "About Me" will send the visitor to the About Me section. The link "My Work" will send the visitor to the area in the page where there is a link to my Github and also there are multiple projects that I have worked on. Two of the projects, I work on them alone and there are two other group projects with other contributors. 

# Challenges

Learning Flexbox was the challenging. 

I was able to make a responsive site by changing by using Media Query. This makes it easier for any visitor to read the content on a mobile device.
