MyrlaFlores is a webpage where I am able to showcase the things I have been learning in my Full Stack Bootcamp Program. I will try to incorporate more things as the class progresses. I will be starting this portfolio with HTML and CSS to include flexbox, media queries and CSS variables.

It was challenging to create this webpage from scratch yet it has been of great experience. I found myself frustrated at certain times but eventually after re-starting the project a second time from scratch the syntax and CSS concepts began to make sense. 

I was able to add a recent photo of me and links to sections containing a link to my GitHub and my contact information in form of an email. 

I added these links to the top of my page and they are all clickable but was not able to link them all. I also added the link to GitHub at the bottom of the page. 

I also want to mention, most of the pictures are my own with the exception of the header background. 

I look forward to gaining more experience and getting better as the bootcamp progresses. 

Flexbox was the concept I found most difficult. 

I was able to make a responsive layout by changing the background color as the page changes in pixels. THe color changes at different settings as the window goes below 992px, 768px, and 576px. This also made it easier to read on a mobile device as soon as the page is opened.
